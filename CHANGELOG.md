<b>Changes</b> <br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Admin List GUI.</b> You can now modify the database reflected admin list through AdKats
        settings. You can edit who the admins are, and what level of access they have, without needing to access the database
        manually. All instances of the plugin on your database will reflect the admins you enter.</li>
    <li><b>Admins now have multiple levels of access.</b> They range from full admin (0) to normal player (6). List of
        commands for each level is given below. Admins can issue commands at or below their level. All commands on an admin's
        access level can be used on other admins of any level with the exception of muting.</li>
    <li><b>Commands now have levels of access.</b> Admins need to be at or above certain levels of access to use certain
        commands.</li>
    <li><b>HTTP Server Online.</b> Commands can now be sent to AdKats using procon's internal HTTP server, or through the
        database. Info given below on security of this system.</li>
    <li><b>Player name suggestion system improved.</b> System now considers player names starting with what was typed more
        correct than those with it just somewhere in their name. System will also perform a "fuzzy" player-name search if the
        text admins entered is not valid for any players.</li>
    <li><b>Ghost Commands Fixed.</b> Commands admins send but don't confirm will be auto-canceled if they move on to other
        things. This stops unwanted commands from being acted on after the fact.</li>
    <li><b>TeamSwap can now auto-whitelist X random players in the server each round.</b> The random list is changed each
        round. Use this to generate hype for players to get full access to teamswap. Players are told the first time they
        spawn that they have access. Players who already have access are not added to the auto-whitelist.</li>
    <li><b>Player report logging improved.</b> Whether a report was used by an admin is now logged.</li>
    <li><b>"Admin Assistant" position added.</b> Players who consistently send useful player reports get a small bonus.
        Details below. This can be disabled.</li>
    <li><b>Round Report Handling Improved.</b> Handling changed so admins can enter new reasons that override the report
        reason. The new reason entered will be used instead, and must follow the requirements for a reason defined in
        settings.</li>
    <li><b>Pre-defined messages usable in all commands.</b> All player interaction commands (not say or yell), will
        accept preMessageIDs as input for reasons now. e.g. @kill charlietheunicorn 4 -->
        charlietheunicorn killed for Baseraping Enemy Spawn Area.</li>
    <li><b>Server IDs can be different now, yet still have punishments increase across servers.</b> Now the origin of
        reports wont show as coming from the same server, since same server ID was required before for global punishments.</li>
    <li><b>Added new commands.</b> Kick all Players, and Nuke Server.</li>
    <li><b>Commands can now operate in shortened hidden mode.</b> When commands are issued in hidden mode they normally
        require an extra character. e.g. /@kill target reason. They now work with just the slash. e.g. /kill target reason.
    </li>
    <li><b>Commands will target the speaker when entered with no parameters.</b> Most player interaction commands will
        now target the speaker when entered with no parameters. So "@kill" == "@kill SourcePlayerName Self-Inflicted". Report
        and call admin will not do this, in addition to commands meant for targeting multiple players.</li>
    <li><b>Additional ban message option added.</b> e.g. Optionally add "appeal at www.yoursite.com" to the end of bans.</li>
    <li><b>30 seconds now hardcoded as punishment timeout.</b> Setting was only editable for testing purposes.</li>
    <li><b>Optimizations in code, database, and settings handling.</b></li>
</ul>
<h4>0.2.5.1 (6-JUNE-2013)</h4>
<b>Changes</b> <br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Bug-fixes.</b> Some documented bugs in the issues section (milestone 0.2.5.1) are fixed.</li>
    <li><b>Punishment Enhancements.</b> Punishment timout has been reduced to 20 seconds.</li>
    <li><b>IRO Punishments Added.</b> Immediate Repeat Offence. If a player gets punished more than once in a 5 minute
        time span, the subsequent punishes were be worth 2 infraction points instead of just 1.</li>
    <li><b>Messaging Enhancements.</b> Pre-say and pre-yell commands have been removed, and now the preMessage IDs can
        be used in regular say, yell, and any other commands that need a reason or message.</li>
    <li><b>Pre-Message Enhancements.</b> Use of pre-defined messages can be required now.</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.3.0.0 (13-JULY-2013)</h4>
<b>Changes</b> <br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Performance.</b> All actions, parsing, and database communications take place on their own threads now,
        increasing performance greatly.</li>
    <li><b>Setting Sync.</b> All plugin settings are now stored in the database, specific to each procon instance.
        Usage shown in readme.</li>
    <li><b>Dependencies.</b> XPKiller's Stat logger is now REQUIRED for AdKats to function. It provides much useful
        information regarding both player and server statistics, which the new Ban Enforcer and AdKats itself use to improve
        your admin abilities.</li>
    <li><b>AdKats WebAdmin API.</b> A website from which you can manage all aspects of your server and playerbase.
        Direct control of players within the server, command feeds, all logs, ban management, and server statistics are all
        included in this site.</li>
    <li><b>AdKats Ban Enforcer.</b> Due to lacking functionality and/or bugs in other ban managers, an internal Ban
        Enforcer is now coded into AdKats. AdKats can now enforce bans accross all of your servers. The Ban Enforcer will
        import and consolidate all bans from every procon instance it's enabled on. Once enabled, bans made on one of your
        servers will be enforced on all others within seconds of issuing the ban. Bans can be made by name, GUID, IP, any
        combination, or all at once. The enforcer works with all existing auto-admins, and requires AdKats WebAdmin for
        ban management. You can use it without WebAdmin, but you will be unable to manage any bans, lift them early, or modify
        them in any way once submitted. Use of the ban enforcer is optional because of this dependency, and is disabled by
        default.</li>
    <li><b>Punishment Enhancements.</b> IRO punishments can now override the low population count and act normally.</li>
    <li><b>Kick/Ban Messages Improved.</b> Frostbite has a 80 character limit for ban/kick messages, and the new ban/kick
        messages comply with that. Also, all kick/ban messages are more descriptive than before, and ban messages in
        particular will tell the player how long their ban is. </li>
    <li><b>Small bug-fixes and enhancements.</b> Messages for errors, player information, and commands, are more
        informative to the users now. Small bugs fixed.</li>
    <li><b>Debug Soldier Added.</b> Set the debug soldier name in settings to get the speed of commands on your server
        sent to you in-game. Time is in milliseconds, from the time you entered it until all actions resulting from that
        command have finished.</li>

        efficient.</li>

<b>Changes</b> <br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Bug-fixes/Enhancements</b> Teamswap queues have been brought back after being fixed. Listplayers calls
        shortened and only handled every 5 seconds, and ban enforcer enforcement should now cause less chat spam.</li>
    <li><b>Added join command</b> @|!|/ join playername will join on that player, with certain access levels.</li>
    <li><b>Punishment logging improved</b> # of player points is now stored in the record message for each punish.</li>

    <li><b>Database connection backup added.</b> Commands will now still carry out their actions if the database
        connection is temporarily lost. It will spam console errors like there's no tomorrow but will still act on commands.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.7.0.0 (15-NOV-2013)</h4>
<b>Changes</b> <br/>
<ul>
    <li>Compatibility with BF4 and BF3 in the same version.</li>
    <li>Certain commands disabled on â€œOfficialâ€ BF4 servers.</li>
    <li>Both plugin description fetching and player list processing are now being processed async to avoid procon
        panic.</li>
    <li>The universal version of XpKillerâ€™s stat logger is now supported. Both versions of stat logger are supported.</li>
    <li>Source ID has been added to the records table. Records will remain connected to a player even if their name
        changes.</li>
    <li>Player ID is now added to all stored chatlogs. XpKillers chat log table is automatically modified to include
        player ID; Thus chat logging functions are taken over by AdKats and force disabled on stat logger.</li>
    <li>AdKats will enter backup mode if your database becomes unavailable temporarily, your connections max out, or it
        becomes overloaded. Stat logger will automatically be disabled if a disconnect is detected, and re-enabled once the
        connection issue has been resolved. This is to prevent procon from entering panic mode and ejecting either plugin
        from the runtime, requiring a layer restart to get them back.</li>
    <li>Experimental tools updated to work on BF3 and BF4</li>
    <li>Round timer added. Rounds can now be automatically ended after X minutes. Countdown to round end is given, and
        the current winning team will win.</li>
    <li>Internal Hacker-Checker released publicly for BF3. This code has been in AdKats for months now, but was set to
        only activate on =ADK= servers. Uses BF3Stats for stat information. Do not use unless you read the documentation on
        github <a href="https://github.com/ColColonCleaner/AdKats/blob/master/README.md#internal-hacker-checker-with-whitelist" target="_blank">(HERE)</a>.
        BF4 version coming soon. </li>
    <li>Round whitelisting of players is no-longer logged in the database</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.0.0.0 (21-DEC-2013)</h4>

    <li>Bug fixes from previous releases.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.1.0.0 (14-FEB-2014)</h4>
<b>Changes</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>TeamSwap</b> Auto-Whitelisting per round has been removed as an option.</li>
</ul>
<b>Enhancements</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Added @accept and @deny, for acting on round reports.</b> No actions against players will be taken when using these commands, they are for helping or hindering AA status for a player. A system coming currently under testing on our servers for automatic report actions will make use of this.</li>
    <li><b>Added @admins command</b> Accessible to to admins and admin assistants by default. Returns the list of online admins in the server.</li>
    <li><b>Added @lead command</b> Lead command will give the speaker leader of their current squad.</li>
    <li><b>Team Enhancements</b> Team names are now detected every match, so factions US, RU, and CN for nuke and kickall now hit the correct team.</li>
    <li><b>Command Enhancements</b> Target player names entered with 1 character will no longer be automatically acted on. Will require a confirm.</li>
    <li><b>Email Enhancements</b> All emails sent through AdKats are now sent as blind carbon copy. Emails are now added to a queue when multiple need to be sent in succession.</li>
    <li><b>List Enhancements</b> Added adkats_specialplayers database table. This table can be used for assigning special whitelists, access, and blacklists. Valid groups are currently slot_reserved, slot_spectator, whitelist_multibalancer, blacklist_dispersion, and whitelist_hackerchecker. Players can be added by ID, or by identifier (name, guid, or IP), and can be assigned, a game and server to apply the list to. If you use player IDs then you wont need to update player names if they change their names, the player names will automatically update when they join the server.</li>
    <li><b>Orchestration Enhancements</b> Default In-Game Admin is automatically disabled when AdKats is running. Had some issues where people accidentally had both plugins running.</li>
    <li><b>User Enhancements</b> Game type is now displayed for players connected to users. Add Soldier now checks across all games and fetches up to 10 matching player names. When adding a new user an automatic check for players of the same name is performed.</li>
    <li><b>Player Info Enhancements</b> All custom messages in AdKats, when targeted at a player, player information string replacements will be parsed. e.g. %player_name%, or %player_id%</li>
    <li><b>Admin Assistant Enhancements</b> Completely reconstructed system with previous private features released to the public. Also added grandfathering for Admin Assistants; >75 confirmed reports overall will also grant admin assistant status.</li>
    <li><b>MatchCommand Enhancements</b> AdKats is now callable from other plugins like InsaneLimits for issuing commands and fetching current synced admin list.</li>
    <li><b>Ban Enforcer Enhancements</b> All bans are now enforced on a server group basis. If a ban is issued on one server group, it will only be enforced on other servers in that server group. Added ban reason and banning admin name to mini-ban-management.</li>
    <li><b>Hacker-Checker Enhancements</b> Added KPM check to hacker checker.</li>
    <li><b>Procon Ban Enhancements</b> When using procon bans, the banning admin name is now added to the front of the reason.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Stability</b> Some issues with thread deadlock injected in previous versions have been resolved.</li>
    <li><b>Commands</b> All in-game commands are rejected with message during AdKats startup/reboot until full player list has been processed, this avoids killer/victim null case. Punishment timeout now blocks action, not just upload, matching spec. Kill-on-spawn for players now happens at the appropriate time, avoiding a previous double-kill issue. Players spamming @rules will no-longer spawn multiple rule printers. Rules command now shows the current rule # and total, e.g. (1/10)...(2/10)...etc...</li>
    <li><b>Ban Enforcer</b> Linked accounts were causing ID issues with ban enforcer, this is now fixed. Name bans through Procon sometimes failed propagation, this has been fixed. Unsupported round bans caused permabans in ban enforcer since type was not recognized, this has been changed to 1 hour temp-ban.</li>
    <li><b>Records</b> Logic hole where debug/exception record messages could overwrite main record messages of the same ID has been closed.</li>
    <li><b>Hacker Checker</b> Bug where hacker-checker mesh with BF3Stats was failing has been fixed.</li>
    <li><b>Chat</b> All chat messages are now trimmed before handling, both before and after command prefix parsing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.2.0.5 (21-MAR-2014)</h4>
<b>Changes</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Settings.</b> AdKats settings are now stored database side almost exclusively. They have always been stored there, but now have been removed from procon's plugin setting list. The only things remaining plugin side are DB connection settings, setting lock information, and debug level.</li>
    <li><b>Command Access during Startup.</b> Commands cannot be accessed until the first player listing is complete, all commands issued before this is complete are rejected. Looking at our current systems this usually takes about 1 minute after initial startup. Admins are informed in-game when the startup sequence has completed, and how long it took to complete.
    </li>
</ul>
<b>Enhancements</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>Added setting lock.</b> Settings in AdKats can now be locked with a password. This is so you can give lower level admins access to mini-ban-management (and some other basic functions), without endangering your other settings.</li>
    <li><b>Orchestration Enhancement.</b> Automatic MULTIBalancer whitelisting for admins is now an optional selection.</li>
    <li><b>Orchestration Enhancement.</b> Automatic reserved slot for the AdKats user list is now an optional selection.</li>
    <li><b>Orchestration Enhancement.</b> Automatic spectator slot for the AdKats user list is now an optional selection.</li>
    <li><b>Command Enhancement.</b> Lead command can now be targeted at a player.</li>
    <li><b>Command Enhancement.</b> Rules command can now be targeted at a player.</li>
    <li><b>Added uptime command.</b> Debug and information purposes; Gives info on server, procon, and AdKats uptime, along with a couple other things.</li>
    <li><b>Added assist command.</b> Will move the requesting player to the weak/losing team and thank them for doing so.</li>
    <li><b>Added spectator slot command.</b> Will add the player to spectator slots for the current server.</li>
    <li><b>Added reserved slot command.</b> Will add the player to reserved slots for the current server.</li>
    <li><b>Added disperse command.</b> Will add the player to MULTIBalancer even dispersion for the current server.</li>

    <li>Added access method option to all commands, for restriction of how commands can be executed. Applies only to commands issued by in-game players. Confirm and cancel commands cannot use settings other than 'Any'.</li>
    <li>Now automatically removing expired special player entries from the database.
Added small improvements to fuzzy player match response text.</li>
    <li>Decreased size of ping kick message to reduce chat spam.</li>
    <li>Improved integration with AdKatsLRT, the loadout enforcer plugin.</li>
    <li>Added more information to all error messages thrown during plugin auto-update.</li>

    <li>Automatic assign of specialplayer group to role did not re-fetch access list, so it appeared to be broken until next access fetch.</li>
    <li>MULTIBalancer whitelist feed was using player names instead of GUIDs.</li>
    <li>Database disconnects and thread exits were not handled properly in several places.</li>
    <li>Procon could freeze when editing the user list without users in the list.</li>

</ul>
<b>Upgrade SQL from 4.0.0.0 - Current</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>No upgrade SQL required.</b></li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.0.0 (15-OCT-2017)</h4>
<b>Enhancements</b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>When a player is kicked for VIP, the plugin is sometimes able to tell admins who was kicked. DICE's event for this is unreliable, but when it works properly, the plugin will tell admins about the VIP kick.</li>
	<li>Added automatic server restart options. When the server is empty (aside from seeder accounts), and the server uptime is greater than a configured number of hours, the server is automatically rebooted. You also have the option to do an automatic procon shutdown when this happens. If you have procon configured to automatically reboot when a crash/shutdown occurs this will effectively reboot your procon layer and the server at the same time.</li>
	<li>Increased performance of the anti-cheat scripts. AdKats now stores player’s battlelog persona IDs in the database, so fetching their info from battlelog is faster and requires fewer requests.</li>
	<li>Decreased startup time of the loadout enforcer when paired with AdKats. Battlelog information needs to be fetched for every player before anti-cheat requests begin now.</li>
	<li>Commands that are classified as admin commands (commands that when enabled will make a role be considered admin), show up in the list with [ADMIN] next to them. Commands that are causing a role to be considered admin will have a '<---' next to the command, so it's easy to find those commands in the list.</li>
	<li>In addition to the "IRO Overrides Low Population" setting i've added a setting for minimum infractions before it overrides. With this setting a player will need at least that many infractions against them before IRO will override low population.</li>
	<li>Added a setting to disable the display of all ping enforcer messages in the procon chat tab. Messages for players kicked for ping are still displayed.</li>
	<li>The "Top Player Monitor" has been completely gutted and rebuilt. This section is now called the "Team Power Monitor" and shows the estimated power of each team in your server. You have options to use join reassignment based on team power and seeder balancing. The other sections of this system are either nonfunctional or experimental, and I would advise caution when using them. The scrambler might be good for your server, but it locks players to their assigned teams which means it's not good for volatile maps like metro.</li>
	<li>Added discord integration with the same options as the existing teamspeak integration. The only unfortunate side being that I can only update discord information (online players) every 5 minutes. This is because Procon is still on .NET 3.5 and doesn't have access to websockets.</li>
	<li>Admins can now bypass the spambot whitelist for certain messages by adding [whitelistbypass] to the start of the message. Useful for important/time-sensitive announcements.</li>
	<li>Added an all-caps chat limiter, with a bunch of settings for how a message is considered all-caps. Also added a new group so you can have only specific players targeted by this script.</li>
	<li>Completely redesigned the assist command for use with the team power monitor.</li>
	<li>Players that use the /assist command are now automatically queued for 5 minutes if their assist request fails. This is so players wanting to assist don't need to keep executing the command to see if they are allowed. After 5 minutes their assist request is automatically cancelled.</li>
	<li>A setting for the minimum number of minutes into a round before the /assist command becomes available has been added.</li>
	<li>Updated the assist messages to include a player's current calculated power.</li>
	<li>Added an option to disable the enforcement of single instances of AdKats on a server. This is for people who have issues with the /AdKatsInstanceCheck messages being stored in external systems. These messages are used by AdKats to make sure that one and only one instance is running on a server at a time, since it can cause undesirable results to have multiple instances running at the same time.</li>
	<li>Added a ban filter option for posting to metabans, so you can choose which bans are sent to the service.</li>
	<li>Add integration for PushBullet in the same manner that AdKats uses email integration.</li>
	<li>The nuke command can now accept team IDs in addition to team keys. This is mainly for people who run servers with the same faction as both teams and were previously unable to nuke team “2”.</li>
	<li>The server shutdown command now provides a 5 second countdown before rebooting the server.</li>
	<li>Moved the auto-nuke settings into its own setting section so it’s easier to configure.</li>
	<li>Added minimum and maximum ticket counts for the auto-surrender/auto-nuke so you can limit when it can activate during a round.</li>
	<li>The auto-nuke script is now able to issue timed nukes on players. This means a nuke is able to hold the target team's player dead for a specified amount of time, making the nuke more effective. I've also added options to increase the nuke duration as the number of times a team is nuked increases.</li>
	<li>Added options to reset the auto-nuke trigger counts when a nuke is fired, this way the script has time to reset after a nuked team loses a lot of flags.</li>
	<li>Added option for minimum duration between nukes to the auto-nuke script so you can configure how often it can fire.</li>
	<li>Added option to make nukes fire based on ticket difference instead of flags, so you can configure teams which have had the map for a long time to be pushed back regardless.</li>
	<li>Added option to configure how many nukes can fire during a round.</li>
	<li>Added option to switch back to auto-surrender after a certain number of nukes are fired and the team is still having trouble.</li>
	<li>Added an optional countdown before an auto-nuke is actually fired, giving players a chance to realize what's about to happen.</li>
	<li>Added option to notify players of perks that are expiring soon. Included the new /perks command so they can see what perks they have. Included a setting for how long before their perks expire to notify them.</li>
	<li>Added the "Battlecry" system. This section lets you allow players have a message sent to the server when they first spawn in, an announcement of their arrival. Options are available to change how "loud" the messages are and who is able to access their usage. You can also configure a list of banned words in the battlecry, and a max length on the battlecry.</li>
	<li>Added a BF4 faction randomizer so you can have random faction assignments in your server. There are many options for how the randomness should be handled.</li>
	<li>Split the 'Inform reputable players and admins of admin joins' into two separate settings, one for reputable players, and one for admins.</li>
	<li>Updated all the procon chat messages AdKats posts to be color coded for different operations. Added tags for some things like the spambot so its messages can be picked out of the tab easily.</li>
	<li>Messages in your rules and spambot can now be map/mode specific. Simply by adding a prefix to the messages and rules you can make them appear only on those maps or modes. Great for mixed mode servers.</li>
	<li>AdKats now monitors player clan tag changes, keeps a history of them, and notifies admins of changes. Tag history is also included in the player info command.</li>
	<li>Added domination to the list of modes where flag estimations are shown in the ticket rate messages.</li>
	<li>Added estimated winner and win time to the ticket rate messages.</li>
	<li>In BF4 since the in-game menu does not tell players why they were kicked or banned anymore, so AdKats now spams the kicked or banned player for a few seconds before they are booted to make sure they know why it happened.</li>
	<li>Improved some of the integrations with the loadout enforcer plugin. Specifically for report actions and manual loadout fetching.</li>
	<li>Added %map_name% and %mode_name% options to the email handler for reports.</li>
	<li>Improved the player info command to show actual hour count the player has in the server, in addition to the calculated weeks/days/hours string.</li>
	<li>Cleaned up quite a few messages which were unnecessarily long.</li>
	<li>Added more robust monitoring of player listing and server info triggers, making sure AdKats doesn’t oversaturate procon or the server with requests.</li>
	<li>Fortified exception handling in a lot of areas.</li>
	<li>Average AdKats startup durations are stored for the last 15 reboots, and displayed in the startup message when it fully completes.</li>
	<li>Estimated time until the plugin is finished starting up are now displayed to players attempting to issue commands during the startup phase. Once startup has completed they are notified and thanked for their patience.</li>
</ul>
<b>New Commands</b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>server_nuke_winning - Added a winning-nuke command, which is only able to nuke the currently winning and map dominant team. Helps to avoid human error when manually issuing nukes.</li>
	<li>player_ping - You can now fetch any player’s current ping and average ping with the fetch ping command.</li>
	<li>player_forceping - Admins can now force AdKats to issue manual pings on specific players using the force ping command. These players will be manually pinged by the layer instead of relying on the server provided info on their ping.</li>
	<li>player_debugassist - The debug assist command was added mainly for my own purposes, so i can see if a player would be allowed to assist without actually having them do it. But it could be useful to some people.</li>
	<li>player_perks - Players are now able to fetch their current list of perks with the player perks command. This command can also be targeted at a player to fetch that player’s perks.</li>
	<li>player_loadout - You can now fetch a player’s current loadout if you’re running the loadout enforcer, using the loadout command.</li>
	<li>player_loadout_force - Players loadouts can now be manually forced up to trigger level enforcement if you’re running the loadout enforcer, with the force loadout command.</li>
	<li>self_battlecry - Players can set their own battlecry using the battlecry command.</li>
	<li>player_battlecry - Admins can use the player battlecry command to set other player’s current battle cries.</li>
	<li>player_discordlink - Admins can link an active player in the server with a member in the discord server by ID using the discord link command.</li>
	<li>player_blacklistallcaps - Admins can make specific players fall under enforcement of the all caps chat limiter using the all caps blacklist command.</li>
	<li>player_blacklistallcaps_remove - Admins can remove players from the all caps blacklist specific enforcement using the remove all caps blacklist command.</li>
</ul>
<b>Changes</b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>Reserved slot feed for *online* admins has been renamed to match what it actually does, add a VIP kick whitelist.</li>
	<li>Weapon code posting to the centralized weapon code display has been removed since all weapon codes for the supported games are known now.</li>
	<li>Everything that was previously named "Hacker-Checker" is now named "Anti-Cheat". The command /hcwhitelist is also renamed to /acwhitelist to go along with this change.</li>
	<li>Players in teamspeak/discord are now automatically whitelisted from spambot messages.</li>
	<li>Automatic forgives for clean play no longer require positive reputation.</li>
	<li>Changed a lot of messages around the plugin which used a team’s name/key to also include the team ID in the message in the format ID/Key.</li>
	<li>The ‘time on server’ section of the player info command no longer says ‘+ current session’. The current session time is simply added to the base and displayed now.</li>
	<li>The mark command is no longer used to force player loadouts, there is a separate command for that now. The mark command is now only used to mark a player for leave notifications.</li>
	<li>Removed the concept of 'adjusted' ticket rates from the UI. The rates shown to you for flag based modes are now by default the adjusted rates, normal rates are shown for non-map modes.</li>
	<li>Added a block against negative values in the minimum surrender/auto-nuke ticket gap setting.</li>
	<li>Added block against people adding a minimum ticket rate window value greater than the maximum ticket rate window value, and vice-versa. The values will now automatically swap when the user attempts this.</li>
	<li>Records in the extended round stats table older than 60 days are now automatically purged.</li>
	<li>First join/first spawn messages are now blocked when the plugin is recently started. This is to make sure that players are not spammed when you reboot the plugin during an active round.</li>
	<li>Player leave notifications are no longer given based on private say/yell/tell messages through AdKats, all other action commands still result in a notification.</li>
	<li>Kicks against yourself are no longer announced to the server.</li>
	<li>Ticket rates in procon chat are now only displayed during an active round where ticket counts have changed, before they would still display during the pre-round phase.</li>
	<li>Forgiving players into negative infraction point values is now blocked.</li>
	<li>Replaced all mentions of @command in the plugin with !command.</li>
	<li>Issuing the kill command on a player will now announce that action to the server like other actions do.</li>
	<li>Removed messages about global timing fetch errors.</li>
	<li>Removed the restrictions on player names which were in place for BF3. Now most characters can be used in player names. The unfortunate side of this is those characters still cause issue fetching from battlelog.</li>
	<li>Changed population success notification to be a tell instead of a say.</li>
	<li>The players ColColonCleaner and PhirePhrey are automatically added to reserved slots for any server running AdKats.</li>
	<li>IP-API communication errors are now changed to debug messages instead of error messages, since they are not crucial to the function of AdKats.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bugs Fixed</b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where players could end up being infinitely queued for anti-cheat checks if their battlelog info was unavailable.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where players would not get updated battlelog information after the first fetch was complete, specifically on new rounds.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where players could end up being infinitely queued for IP info fetches if the server failed to respond, or if they left the server before it did.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where errors were thrown because some player’s battlelog information exceeded the size of 32 bit integers, increased the size of those variables.</li>
	<li>Fixed the DPS ban messages to contain the proper code 4 prefix.</li>
	<li>Fixed the KPM ban messages to contain the proper code 5 prefix.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where modifying a role's authorized commands would shoot you back to the top of the setting list. Basically now it waits a while before modifying the tags on those settings in the procon view.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where allowing commands from muted players would allow them to simply place a command prefix in front of the message and it wouldn’t act on them. Now it confirms that the command is valid and exists.</li>
	<li>Assist command timeout had incorrect calculations due to the duration of the command. This has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes players could spawn while a nuke is happening and remain alive.</li>
	<li>Fixed some of the message formatting sent by the active round reports command.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where surrender voting included spectators/commanders in the required player count calculation to surrender.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the populator monitor would not fetch updated populator players immediately when that section was enabled, it would have to wait for the next user list update (5 minute interval).</li>
	<li>Fixed chat spam during off hours caused by the spambot, making sure that those messages are only visible in the chat tab when there are at least 5 players in the server.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where AFK player monitor would count all players (commanders/spectators) instead of just the active round players.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where AdKats and some auto-balancer plugins could fight over where a player should be if an admin moved them. AdKats would never give up the fight for control of the player and that resulted in an infinite loop of swapping the player between teams. AdKats now gives up the fight if a players has 8 or more moves in 5 seconds.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where a player who was previously assigned a team leaving the server would delete their assigned team, allowing them to join back and switch to their original team. AdKats now remembers their assigned team when the leave and rejoin during a single round.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where using section 4-2 to add command target whitelist to a role would have no effect.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where players were able to use the join command on themselves to get a free admin kill. They were also able to use this on a current squadmate for the same reason. These are now blocked.</li>
	<li>Blocked usage of the join/pull commands from spectator and commander player types.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where ‘previous’ bans could end up being imported into the plugin. The bans wouldn’t be issued again but it caused unnecessary processor work.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where a player could be added to multiple users at the same time.</li>
	<li>Fixed player fetch performance in several scenarios. Sometimes a player which was already loaded was still fetched from the database again.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where admin assistants who were considered ‘grandfathered’ would cause fetching issues.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the spectator slot feed would attempt to add more than 15 players to the list. For some reason DICE added a 15 player limit to the spectator slot list. When you have more than 15 approved spectators now it just manually monitors the list and keeps the official spectator list empty.</li>
	<li>Fixed a few error possibilities coming from the ping enforcer.</li>
	<li>Fixed an error where comparing command input with player names could crash.</li>
	<li>Removed extra message spam caused by the private messaging system.</li>
	<li>Removed extra message spam caused by player say/yell/tell commands issued by external plugins.</li>
	<li>Fixed shutdown durations in some cases, making sure threads automatically exit when you shut down the plugin.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where battlelog going offline would cause a lot of errors to be thrown by the plugin. Now the plugin will wait at 30 second intervals and show warnings if battlelog is offline.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the admin assistant whitelist could be given to admin roles in section 4-2. That whitelist is not supposed to be used for admin roles.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the !help command would return commands which were supposed to be background commands.</li>

<b>Upgrade SQL from 4.0.0.0 - Current</b><br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>No upgrade SQL required.</b></li>
</ul>
<h4>7.0.1.0 (12-JAN-2018)</h4>
<b>Enhancements</b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>Added team power monitor unswitcher functionality. The system can now block a player from moving between teams conditionally based on team power metrics, still allowing them to move to the weak team.</li>
	<li>Added a display for the current server round number under the server settings section.</li>
	<li>Improved the log message description when you turn on team power monitor reassignment.</li>
	<li>AdKats can now detect if a player is stuck in a move loop and cancel moving the player. This can happen if an admin moved a player to team A but the server's autobalancer wants them to be on team B. The two plugins could get in an infinite fight over where the player should be and prevent them from spawning. Now AdKats will give up the fight after a few seconds.</li>
	<li>Added some custom team power adjustments for conquest large metro to better balance things on that map when using the team power monitor.</li>
	<li>Added the ability for AdKats to buff a very weak team by 1-4 players over the other team depending on population and map state so they have a chance. This only applies to newly joining players and is only active when the team power reassignment setting is enabled.</li>
	<li>Cleaned up a few chat messages to be more descriptive/more concise as needed.</li>
	<li>If a non-admin player attempts to use a command they don't have access to in public chat, a chat message is now displayed to the server letting them know the previous player is not actually an admin. Helps with the case where someone types !ban playername reason when they aren't an admin and people get the false impression that they actually are an admin.</li>
</ul>
<b>New Commands</b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>Added the ignore loadout command for use when AdKats is being run in tandem with the loadout enforcer. This command is useful when battlelog is lagging on a player's loadout and it's claiming they have an item when they don't. Issue the loadout ignore command on the player and they will no longer be wrongfully slain by the loadout enforcer due to the battlelog data issue.</li>
</ul>
<b>Changes</b><br/>
<ul>
	<li>Reduced the maximum high population nuke duration from 120 seconds to 60 seconds.</li>
	<li>Reduced the maximum medium population nuke duration from 120 seconds to 45 seconds.</li>
	<li>Reduced the maximum low population nuke duration from 120 seconds to 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>Reduced the maximum auto nuke duration increase from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.</li>
