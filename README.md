<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Main</h3>
<p>
This tool was designed for use by groups with high traffic servers and many admins, but will function just as well 
for small servers.
</p>
<h3>Punishment/Forgiveness System</h3>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This is NOT the player-based punish/forgive system normally used for teamkilling, and is only usable by
admins.<br/>
<br/>
<B>TLDR:</b> Use of punish and forgive commands takes the load off admins remembering what players have broken 
server rules, and how many times. Each time a player is punished it's logged in the database, and the more punishes 
they get the more  severe the punishment. Available punishments include kill, kick, temp-ban 60 minutes, temp-ban 1 
week, and permaban. Order that the punishments are given can be configured to your needs.<br/>
<br/>
After a player is 'punished' (and the Punish log is made in the database), their total points are calculated using 
this basic formula:<br/>
<b>(Punishment Count - Forgiveness Count = Total Points)</b></center><br/>
Then an action is decided using total points from the punishment hierarchy. Punishments should get more harsh as the
player gets more points. The punishment hierarchy is configurable to suit your needs, but the default is below.<br/>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Total Points</b></td>
		<td><b>Punishment Outcome</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Less than 1</b></td>
		<td>Kill</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>1</b></td>
		<td>Kill</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>2</b></td>
		<td>Kill</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>3</b></td>
		<td>Kick</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>4</b></td>
		<td>Kick</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>5</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 60 Minutes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>6</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 60 Minutes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>7</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 1 Week</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>8</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 1 Week</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>9</b></td>
		<td>Perma-Ban</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Greater Than 9</b></td>
		<td>Perma-Ban</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Players may also be 'forgiven', which will reduce their total point value by 1 each time, this is useful if you have a
website where players can apologize for their actions in-game. Players can be forgiven into negative total point values 
which is why a 'less than 1' clause is needed.<br/><br/>

You can run multiple servers with this plugin on the same database, as long as you use different serverID's for each 
one in plugin settings. By setting each server to a different ID, rule breaking on one server won't cause increase in 
punishments on another server for that same player. If you want punishments to increase across all your servers, 
make the serverID the same for all. This is available since many groups run different rule sets on each server they 
own, so players breaking rules on one server may not know rules on another, they get a clean slate on each server.
<br/><br/>

When deciding to use this system, 'punish' should be the only command used for player rule-breaking. Other commands 
like kill, or kick are not counted in the system since sometimes players ask to be killed, admins kill/kick themselves, 
or players get kicked for AFKing. Kill and kick should only be used for server management. Direct tban 
and ban are of course still available for hacker/glitching situations, but that is the ONLY time they should be used.
</p>
<h3>Report/CallAdmin System</h3>
<p>
When a player puts in a proper @report or @admin all in-game admins are notified, then the report is logged in the
database with full player names for reporter/target, and the full reason for reporting. All uses of @report and 
@admin with this plugin require players to enter a reason, and will tell them if they haven't entered one. It will 
not send the report to admins unless reports are complete. This cleans up what admins end up seeing for reports 
(useful if admins get reports and admin calls whether they are in-game or not).
<br/>
<h4>Using Report IDs</h4>
All reports are issued a random three digit ID which expires at the end of each round. These ID's can be used in any 
other action command, simply use that ID instead of a player-name and reason (e.g. waffleman73 baserapes, another player 
reports them and gets report ID 582, admins just use @punish 582 instead of @punish waffleman73 baserape). Confirmation 
of command with @yes is required before a report ID is acted on. Players are thanked for reporting when an admin uses 
their report ID.
</p>
<h3>Player Muting</h3>
<p>
Players can be muted using the mute command, muting lasts until the end of the round. Players who talk in chat after 
being muted will be killed each time they talk (up through 5 chat messages), on the 6th message they are kicked from 
the server. No action other than kill or kick is used by this system. There will be no way to un-mute players, there 
was a reason they were muted, and they can talk again next round. Admins cannot mute other admins.
</p>
<h3>Pre-Yell and Pre-Say</h3>
<p>
A list of editable pre-defined messages can be added in settings, then admins can use the message ID instead of typing 
the whole message in. Example: @presay 2 will call the second pre-defined message, admin is asked to confirm the message 
with @yes to make sure it's the one they wanted.
</p>
<h3>TeamSwap</h3>
<p>
TeamSwap is a server-smart player moving system which offers two major benefits over the default system. Normally when 
trying to move a player to a full team the command just fails at the server level, now the player is dropped on a 
queue until a slot opens on that side. They can keep playing on their side until that slot opens, when it does they 
are immediately slain and moved over to fill it. Secondly it allows whitelisted (non-admin) players the ability to move 
themselves between teams as often as they want (within a ticket count window). This is currently not an available option 
in default battlefield aside from procon commands, the game limits players to one switch per gaming session. Whitelisted 
players can type '@moveme' and teamswap will queue them. This is meant to be available to players outside the admin 
list, usually by paid usage to your community or to clan members only. Admins can also use '@moveme', and in their 
case it bypasses the ticket window restriction.
</p>
<h3>Requiring Reasons</h3>
<p>
All commands which might lead to actions against players are required to have a reason entered, and will cancel if
no reason is given. Players (even the most atrocious in some cases) should know what they were acted on for.
</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>
This plugin has been tested on a 64 player Operation Metro server that is full nearly 24/7 and does not cause any 
noticable lag. AdKats is designed to be rather heavy when changing settings, but much lighter when in use. All 
commands are stored in dictionaries so command meanings are parsed instantly when entered. During command parsing 
there is a hierarchy of checks the command goes through (specific to each command), if any of them fail the process 
ends immediately and informs the calling player of the error they made. Database connections are fast and do not cause 
any noticable lag even when logging everything on a very active server.
</p>
<h3>Database Usage</h3>
<p>
If must use an online MySQL database accessible from your procon layer. If you have your own website you can make one 
there, or you can use an online service. My clan runs our own, but I found this online one to be ok, and has a free 
usage option. http://www.freesqldatabase.com/ But any online accessible MySql database will work. Be careful with that 
free option though, the size is limited, and these things can log A LOT of data if it's an active server.

The plugin checks the database for needed tables on connect. If it doesn't find the proper tables/views it will run 
the script linked below. You can run the script beforehand if you dont want the plugin changing table structure in 
your database.<br/>

</p>
<h3>Available In-Game Commands</h3>
<p>
<u><b>You can edit the text typed for each command to suit your needs in plugin settings.</b></u> Usage of all
commands is database logged by default, but each command can be told whether to log or not. Logging all is useful 
especially when you have to hold 40+ admins accountable, and has not caused noticable lag.<br/><br/>

<h3>Commanding AdKats from Outside the Game</h3>
<p>
AdKats can take orders from external systems via the database. If you have an external system (such as a web-based tool with access to bf3 server information), then have your 
external system add a row to the record table with a new record to be acted on. All information is needed in the row 
just like the ones sent from AdKats to the database. Just make the 'adkats_read' column for that row = "N" and adkats 
will act on that record. Every 5-10 seconds the plugin checks for new input from external systems, and will act on 
them if found. Valid 'command_type's that can be acted on include the following:<br/>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Action To be Performed</b></td>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
<h3>Debugging Settings:</h3>
* <b>'Debug level'</b> - Indicates how much debug-output is printed to the plugin-console. 0 turns off debug messages (just shows important warnings/exceptions), 6 documents nearly every step.
<h3>Admin Settings:</h3>
* <b>'Use Database Admin List'</b> - Whether to use list list of admins from database instead of static list. Admin names are cached in the plugin to save bandwidth. The list is updated when a non-admin tries a command, to see if list has changed.<br/>
* <b>'Admin Table Name'</b> - Name of the database table that contains admin names. Default "tbl_adminlist". This table needs to be set up manually right now, as some people might have an existing admin table.<br/>
* <b>'Column That Contains Admin Name'</b> - Name of the column in admin table that contains admin IGNs.<br/>
* <b>'Current Database Admin List'</b> - <b>(NOT EDITABLE)</b> When using the database admin list, this will show what players are currently admins.<br/>
* <b>'Static Admin List'</b> - List of admins input from plugin settings. Use if no admin database table. Each admin should have their own line.
<h3>Messaging Settings:</h3>
* <b>'Pre-Message List'</b> - List of messages for use in pre-say and pre-yell commands.
<h3>MySQL Settings:</h3>
* <b>'MySQL Hostname'</b> - Hostname of the MySQL server AdKats should connect to. <br/>
* <b>'MySQL Port'</b> - Port of the MySQL server AdKats should connect to, most of the time it's 3306. <br/>
* <b>'MySQL Database'</b> - Database name AdKats should use for storage. Hardcoded table names and creation scripts given below.<br/>
* <b>'MySQL Username'</b> - Username of the MySQL server AdKats should connect to. <br/>
* <b>'MySQL Password'</b> - Password of the MySQL server AdKats should connect to.
<h3>Command Settings:</h3>
* <b>'Minimum Required Reason Length'</b> - The minimum length a reason must be for commands that require a reason to execute.<br/>
* <b>'Yell display time seconds'</b> - The integer time in seconds that yell messages will be displayed.
  <br/><br/>
  <b>Specific command definitions given in features section above.</b> All command text must be a single string with no whitespace. E.G. kill. All commands can be suffixed with '|log', which will set whether use of that command is logged in the database or not.
<h3>Punishment Settings:</h3>
* <b>'Punishment Hierarchy'</b> - List of punishments in order from lightest to most severe. Index in list is the action taken at that number of points.<br/>
* <b>'Only Kill Players when Server in low population'</b> - When server population is below 'Low Server Pop Value', only kill players, so server does not empty. Player points will be incremented normally.<br/>
* <b>'Low Server Pop Value'</b> - Number of players at which the server is deemed 'Low Population'.<br/>
* <b>'Punishment Timeout'</b> - A player cannot be punished more than once every x.xx minutes. This prevents multiple admins from punishing a player multiple times for the same infraction.
<h3>Server Settings:</h3>
* <b>'Server ID'</b> - ID that will be used to identify this server in the database. This is not linked to any specific database attributes, instead it's used to differentiate between servers for infraction points. Set all instances of this tool to the same server ID if you want points to work across servers.
<br/>
<h3>TeamSwap Settings:</h3>
* <b>'Require Whitelist for Access'</b> - Whether the 'moveme' command will require whitelisting. Admins are always allowed to use it.<br/>
* <b>'Static Player Whitelist'</b> - Static list of players plugin-side that will be able to TeamSwap.<br/>
* <b>'Use Database Whitelist'</b> - Whether to use 'adkat_teamswapwhitelist' table in the database for player whitelisting. Whitelisted names are cached in the plugin to save bandwidth. The list is updated when a non-whitelisted player is requesting access, to see if list has changed.<br/>
* <b>'Current Database Whitelist'</b> - <b>(NOT EDITABLE)</b> When using the database whitelist, this will show what players are currently whitelisted.<br/>
* <b>'Ticket Window High'</b> - When either team is above this ticket count, nobody (except admins) will be able to use TeamSwap.<br/>
* <b>'Ticket Window Low'</b> - When either team is below this ticket count, nobody (except admins) will be able to use TeamSwap.
